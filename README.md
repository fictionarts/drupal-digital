# Digital Custom Module

The **Digital** module is a custom Drupal 11 module designed to provide supporting
functionality for the **DigitalTheme** Drupal 11 Bootstrap 5 subtheme.

This module works alongside:

- DigitalTheme Drupal 11 Bootstrap 5 Subtheme  
  https://github.com/fictionarts/drupal-digitaltheme

The purpose of this module is to separate custom Drupal functionality from the
theme layer, following Drupal best practices by keeping application logic inside
a custom module and presentation logic inside the theme. Drupal custom modules
are typically stored separately from themes and provide reusable functionality
across different presentations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
